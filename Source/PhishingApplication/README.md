This malware triggers install_keylog.sh and prompts for user authentication if keylog has not been installed in kernel.

Seems normal in terminal.

Also functions as a currency converter.

Usage:

`$ ./Converter`

The installation bash script is embedded into /usr/bin and as 'keylog,' and can be triggered by command

`$ keylog`

(Can be replaced by other string)

So the keylogger can be reinstalled even after the phshing application is deleted.
